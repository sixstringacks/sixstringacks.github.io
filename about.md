If you can’t explain a concept to someone else, you don’t really know it. I created this site to help cement what I’ve learned and share knowledge with others.

For many years I was a jack-of-all-trades systems engineer and a few years ago I found myself with an abundance of free time on my hands. I decided to use that time to learn some new skills; security/hacking always interested me so I started down the rabbit hole. I got my hands on the recommended books, I read blogs, writeups, tutorials, and after a lot of practice with vulnhub machines and Hack The Box I decided to “try harder” and subsequently obtained the OSCP cert, eventually transitioning to a blue team role. I now do offensive stuff on the side as a hobby in my free time - I like to know how things work, break things, and solve problems which has the side-effect of helping me do a better job on the defensive side.
